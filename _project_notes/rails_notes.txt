Active Record

ORM  - Object Relational Mapping Pattern

Rails is the M in MVC
MVC - Model, View, Controller

Gem install active record
alternatives:
    Sequel
    rom-rb

Test Methods
  Unit test         - only tests one thing. very fast.
    minitest        is the default testing framework in rails
    rspec           requires changes

  Integration Test  - testing multiple things at the same time. Make sure things work together.
                      slower then Unit tests
    capybara  - spell out the steps one at a time.
    cucumber  - read english and turn it into a test. (Jesus doesn't like this method.)
                "Code should be written in code, not English. English is ambiguous" - Jesus Castello 2017

SQLite3

go to terminal and find the folder.
type sqlite3 to open sqlite tools  (.open database)  uses .methods
  create table accounts ("id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, user text, password text);
note - values is only for Insert statements.
  Alter table orders add column account_id integer;
  example of update record.
  update food_descriptions set fdgrp_cd = "01001" where id = 3;

  sql examples:
  select * from food_descriptions limit 10;
  select * from food_descriptions order by id desc limit 10;   # last 10 records
  select * from food_descriptions order by id asc limit 10;

  select Long_Desc from food_descriptions where Long_Desc like "%Bacon%";
  select count(Long_Desc) from food_descriptions where Long_Desc like "%Bacon%";

naming conventions
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html
>>>> the class should be singular and the table should be plural.
you want to refer to an Account.... in the Accounts table.

Using active record we can add records.
example
Account.create(user: "Jesus", password: "test")


examples of using Active Record
puts Account.all.to_sql                                   # creates well formed SQL statements.
Account.all
Account.create(id: 1, user: "steve", password: "pass")    # you don't need to add the id usually.
Account.find                                              # find one record
Account.find_by                                           # only returns the first record it finds.
Account.where password: "something"                       # returns ALL records with the matching phrase.
Account.where "id <= 5"                                   # put expressions inside a string.
Account.delete 4                                          # assuming the id is number 4.
Warning >>>>> Account.update(user: "anything")            # this will update ALL records!!!
Account.find(1).update(id: 10)                            # updates a single record.

tp FoodDescription.where "id >= 3 and id <= 10 "        # the part in the string is actual sql code.
FoodDescription.where( "refuse > 0").count     # count of the records
FoodDescription.group( "fdgrp_cd").count   # count of records by group
FoodDescription.columns


require "table_print"
# be carefule with tp when collecting lots of records.
tp Account.all              # pretty format
tp Account.where "id <= 5"  # pretty format
tp FoodDescription.columns

gem to create fake data
gem faker   # this will create fake data

pry
ls Faker::ChuckNorris
ls Faker::Pokemon
ls Faker::Crypto
   # pay attention to base methods. example >>>>> Faker::Crypto.methods: md5  sha1  sha256

Example:
Account.create(user: Faker::Book.author, password: Faker::Crypto.md5)

10.times      # will result in Enumerator...   (it needs a block to operate upon.) # most basic loop.

Example:
1000.times{Account.create(user: Faker::Book.author, password: Faker::Crypto.md5)}

Account.delete_all   # will remove all records.
Account.count

..................
Relational databases
account_id

Active Record command for beginning to use relational tables.
Example:
Order.find(1).update(account_id: 12032)

............
First relational statement

a = Order.find 1     => #<Order:0x007f9abeea0848 id: 1, order_notes: "Elsa Rempel", account_id: 12032>
a.account            => #<Account:0x007f9ac4073bc0 id: 12032, user: "Schuyler Feest", password: "a27a0087e0f60767acd8df9c28e9e7c5">


.......
If you get multiple results from your array_like object the result is enumerable.
if the account has more then one order
b.each{|x| x.account}


attr_reader :title, :author     # creates the methods to access read the data.
attr_accessor :title, :author
pry(main)> ls Book    # shows the methods
examples:
book1 = Book.new
book2 = Book.new

book1.title="first book"
book1.author="steve"
book1.anything_else   # error unless it is part of attribute accessor.

.....
testing foreign keys
examples:
FoodDescription.first.food_group
FoodDescription.last.food_group

these are based on:
class FoodDescription  < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :food_group, foreign_key: :FdGrp_Cd, primary_key: :FdGrp_Cd
end

class FoodGroup  < ActiveRecord::Base
  # works with table food_groups
  belongs_to :food_description
end

.....
FoodGroup.first.food_description


..........
when all else fails.... think ruby magic is failing you... in the case below the value of Long_Desc is confused as a constant when you want it to be a method.

class FoodDescription  < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :food_group, foreign_key: :FdGrp_Cd, primary_key: :FdGrp_Cd

  def inspect
    #without the self it thinks it is a constant becuase it starts with upper case. to compensate the self. is added to specifically tell ruby it is a method and not a constant.

    self.Long_Desc
  end
end
