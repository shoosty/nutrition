Give me a list of foods based on calories, content (magnesium)

Look up specific food and see the nutritional profile.


Food energy is expressed in terms of both kilocalories and kilojoules. (One kilocalorie
equals 4.184 kilojoules.) The data are for physiologic energy values remaining after
losses due to digestion and metabolism have been deducted. Further discussions on
energy and caloric factors used in SR can be found in the “Food Description File” of the
general documentation.
The specific calorie factors used for calculating energy values in beef products are:
