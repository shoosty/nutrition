# how to compare the record count total to the count of the records by the groups.
#count of records
FoodDescription.count
# using inject on the hash we can count the values of the keys.
# the trick is to put a default value parameter on inject that applies to the accumulator (a)
FoodDescription.group( "fdgrp_cd").count.inject(0){|a, b| a += b[1] }

# compare values in groups to total records
# a = accumulator   b = iterator 
FoodDescription.group( "fdgrp_cd").count.inject(0){|a, b| a += b[1] } == FoodDescription.count
